abstract = {In a fusion power plant the transport at the plasma edge must be carefully controlled so that power is deposited onto material surfaces designed to handle it. There has been growing interest in the role played in this transport by field-aligned filamentary structures, particularly with the advent of fast high-resolution cameras able to resolve their fast dynamics. This thesis presents experimental analysis of filamentary structures at the plasma edge in the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST), and compari- son with the BOUT 2-fluid 3D simulation code. Data from a reciprocating Langmuir probe close to the plasma edge has been analysed using sta- tistical techniques, demonstrating the robustness of the differencing and rescaling method. Combined with autocorrelation function and Fourier spectra, this has been used to demonstrate the presence of correlations between filaments over long times, and the destruction of this correlation in dithering H-mode plasmas. Camera images recorded at a rate of 100kHz of L-mode plasmas have been compared to data recorded simultaneously by the reciprocating probe. This shows that the statistical properties of data from the reciprocating probe are separated into those due to the structure of individual filaments and those due to correlations between filaments. Camera images have been systematically analysed using a automated and semi-automated codes to determine the properties of filaments at the plasma edge, finding mode numbers n ∼ 30, typical filament widths of ∼ 9cm, and a mean toroidal velocity of 3.55±0.05km/s in the co-current direction. Radial velocities in the range of 0.5−1.5km/s are observed. The BOUndary Turbulence (BOUT) code has been modified and used to simulate MAST L-mode plasmas, showing agreement with many aspects of the experimental data, including similar toroidal widths (∼ 5cm), ra- dial velocities up to ∼ 2km/s and time-scales. The BOUT simulations show the presence of an electrostatic drift-type wave 1 − 2cm inside the separatrix rotating toroidally in the electron diamagnetic drift direction (counter-current) with a toroidal mode-number n ∼ 15 − 35 and a fre- quency of ∼ 50kHz. This wave is broken up by turbulent dynamics close to the separatrix, forming many smaller plasma “blobs” (n ∼ 60 − 90) whilst accelerating in the toroidal direction from ∼ 0.7km/s to ∼ 1.9km/s counter-current. Some of these blobs are then accelerated radially out- wards into the SOL. Detailed analysis of the relative magnitudes of drive terms in the reduced Braginskii equations solved by BOUT has been performed. This indicates a change in the dynamics across the separatrix, from a regime where 3D effects are important to essentially 2D dynamics in the SOL.},

abstract = {Measurements of the polarization effects in multimirror experiments by using a dual photoelastic modulator are described. The effect of single and multiple mirrors in polarization measurements in two and three dimensions is discussed, and experimental results show how symmetrical placement of mirrors in three-dimensional geometry can eliminate changes in the polarization. Calibration procedures for a dual photoelastic modulator and potential error sources such as misalignment of analyzer, signal dc offset, and neglect of aperture size are presented. Mirror-surface evolution and how it can disturb the polarization measurement are also addressed.},

abstract = {Edge localized modes (ELMs), that are present in most tokamak H- (high confinement) modes, can cause significant damage to plasma facing components in fusion reactors. Controlling ELMs is considered necessary and hence it is vital to understand the underlying physics. The stability of ELMs is typically expressed in terms of the pressure gradient ∇p in the edge and the edge current density j. Both ∇p and j are usually derived from profiles fitted to the measured edge density and temperature profiles, where for the calculation of j neoclassical theory is used.This paper presents direct measurements of the magnetic pitch angle $\gamma$m evolution in the edge and the derived j. These provide a method to validate the j as derived with neoclassical theory and they open up the possibility to find a complete, self-consistent set of edge profiles, that fit density, temperature and $\gamma$m measurements, hence allowing for a more accurate stability analysis.},
